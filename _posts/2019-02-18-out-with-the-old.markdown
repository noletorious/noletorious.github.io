            <p>I've turned building my portfolio into a hobby. It has become a sort of a healthy obsession of mine were I get to bring together the principles I've learned as a web designer and apply it to my own portfolio. Below are screenshots of past portfolios and what they were generally built with:</p>
            <img class="img-fluid border rounded" src="/assets/images/2012.png" alt="" />
            <p class="text-right text-muted pb-2"> ᒻ <span>2012</span> - Built with HTML,CSS,JS</p>
            <img class="img-fluid border rounded" src="/assets/images/2014.png" alt="" />
            <p class="text-right text-muted pb-2"> ᒻ <span>2014</span> - Built with Wordpress</p>
            <img class="img-fluid border rounded" src="/assets/images/2015.png" alt="" />
            <p class="text-right text-muted pb-2"> ᒻ <span>2015</span> - Built with Firebase, Materialize</p>
            <img class="img-fluid border rounded" src="/assets/images/2017.png" alt="" />
            <p class="text-right text-muted pb-2"> ᒻ <span>2017</span> - Built static HTML plus Bootstrap</p>
            <p>This time I've built the site with a combination of Jekyll and Github pages. Next one I will be using React!✌️ </p>
