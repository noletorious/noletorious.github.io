            <p>Building my portfolio has inadvertently become a hobby of mine. It has sort of become a healthy obsession of my bringing together the skills I've learned as a UI designer and applying it to my own showcase. Below screenshots of my portfolios before. Looking at them with a new set of eyes I think its always good practice to critique your own work retrospectively.</p>
